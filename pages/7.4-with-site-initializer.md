# 7.4 with Site Initializer

Testray 2.0 relies on Site Initializer to provide all the assets and structure necessary to use on 7.4

With Site Initializer we do:

<v-clicks>

  - Create the Site.
  - Create Object Definition, Relationships, Populate Data, add PickList and more.
  - Define Layout Configuration, Fragments, Stylebook.
  - Define Roles and assign permissions to then.
  - Create Documents in Documents and Media.
  - Create Client Extension.
  
</v-clicks>

<span v-after>

  And so much more can be done with Site Initializer, but those features attend our needs for now.
